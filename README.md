# Project Reflection: 3D Scene Development

Reflecting on this project provided valuable insights into both my design and development processes, enabling me to refine key skills that I can apply in future projects.

## Software Design Approach

- **How do I approach designing software?**
  - Designing software, particularly a 3D scene, involves balancing aesthetics, interactivity, and technical requirements. I approach design by first identifying the core objects and features necessary to meet project goals, then strategically planning their integration into a cohesive scene. By breaking down each element (e.g., lighting, camera control, object textures), I focus on enhancing the overall experience while maintaining clarity and simplicity in design.

- **New Design Skills Gained**
  - Working on this 3D project enhanced my skills in modular design, especially in creating reusable functions for transformations, shading, and texture application. Managing these features modularly reinforced the importance of separating concerns in code, making it easier to iterate on individual features without affecting the entire system.

- **Design Process Followed**
  - I began with scene planning, defining the objects and their textures, then moved on to setting up lighting, camera controls, and user interaction. Following this, I implemented each module, testing regularly to ensure each part functioned well. This process ensured that I could integrate, test, and adjust features incrementally, rather than tackling the entire scene at once.

- **Future Applications of Design Tactics**
  - The modular and organized approach I applied to this project is adaptable to other complex software tasks, especially when working with interactive or visual applications. Separating out transformations, shading, and textures allows for flexibility in design and makes future modifications or feature expansions straightforward. I can see myself using these tactics in developing games, simulations, or any project that requires layered complexity.

## Program Development Approach

- **Approach to Developing Programs**
  - I approach program development by breaking down requirements into specific, actionable tasks and iterating through each. For example, rather than tackling the entire 3D scene in one go, I first focused on creating the objects, then moved on to lighting, camera controls, and finally, interactivity. This incremental approach allowed me to address challenges individually while keeping the project manageable.

- **New Development Strategies Utilized**
  - Iterative development was crucial in this project, especially when working with 3D graphics, where visual feedback directly informs adjustments. Additionally, using modular functions for repetitive tasks (like setting transformations or applying shaders) helped maintain clarity and improve the speed of development. This modular approach also allowed me to reuse functions across different objects, reducing code duplication and streamlining the code structure.

- **Role of Iteration**
  - Iteration was a core part of this development, enabling me to refine lighting, shading, and object interactions incrementally. I frequently adjusted light positioning, object textures, and camera controls based on visual outcomes, which helped me balance aesthetics with functionality effectively.

- **Evolution of Development Approach**
  - My development approach evolved throughout the milestones, moving from a focus on basic functionality to refining user experience and aesthetic detail. Early milestones centered on establishing foundational elements, while later milestones allowed me to focus on optimizing interactions and enhancing visual coherence.

## Reaching Goals Through Computer Science

- **Role of Computational Graphics and Visualizations in My Goals**
  - This project highlighted how computational graphics can be a powerful tool in both creative and technical fields. By learning how to control 3D space, lighting, and interactivity, I gained skills that are useful for diverse applications, such as data visualization, virtual environments, and game development. These skills align well with my goal of working on engaging, visually driven software that combines technical problem-solving with creativity.

- **Educational and Professional Applications of Computational Graphics**
  - Educationally, understanding computational graphics expands my knowledge in areas like geometry, matrix transformations, and shader programming, all of which are applicable in advanced computer science studies. Professionally, skills in computational graphics and visualization are valuable for careers in game development, AR/VR applications, and simulation engineering. These tools are essential for creating immersive environments and meaningful visual interactions, skills that are in high demand across various tech sectors.

Through this project, I solidified my understanding of modular software design, iterative development, and interactive 3D scene composition. The experience has equipped me with a practical foundation in computational graphics, which I can confidently apply to both academic and professional challenges in the future.
